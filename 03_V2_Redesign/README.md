# Abandoning Initial Design (V1)
The first design iteration was fully modeled and analyzed, but it reached a point where several key issues had no realistic or robust solutions within the existing architecture. Despite multiple refinements, the combination of geometric constraints, stress concentrations, assembly limitations, and interface problems (keys, dogs, shaft transitions, etc.) made it clear that continuing to iterate on the same base layout would not lead to a clean or reliable final design. For this reason, the V1 gearbox was OFFICIALLY ditched, and the project is now restarting from a fresh architecture (V2) in order to implement all lessons learned and integrate better design rules from the beginning.

# About This Folder (V2)

This folder contains the **new redesign workflow**.
The V2 design is documented through a dedicated Markdown file that records:

- the restart of the architecture
- the sequence of design decisions
- intermediate sketches and reasoning
- constraints and fixes applied
- and how the new gearbox layout evolves step by step

This approach keeps the development traceable and transparent until the final consolidated report is produced.
