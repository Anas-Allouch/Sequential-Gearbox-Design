## Failure at Keys
When dealing with keys, there are 2 types of failures: failure by shear, and failure by crushing.  
Since im using custom made keys, and not using the same key everywhere, safety factor check is required at every key location.  
In the following, i will show the formulas used to calculate these safety factors:
