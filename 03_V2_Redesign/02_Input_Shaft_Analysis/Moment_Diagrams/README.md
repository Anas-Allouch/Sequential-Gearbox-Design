This folder contains moment diagrams for each case.  
So the concept is that only one gear is engaged, like every other multiple speed gearbox.  
Since my gearbox has 5 speeds plus reverse gear, I will have 6 different cases, each case having 2 moment diagrams, one around y axis and the other around z axis.  
These diagrams are used for input AND output shafts analysis, and that's because the axial positions of all components are the same on input and output shafts.  

These diagrams were drawn with the help of matlab code that can be found in 08_MATLAB_Scripts in the folder dedicated to it.
