This folder presents input shaft analysis. From free body diagram, to moment diagrams for each case that we have, to finally fatigue analysis.  
Regarding fatigue analysis, I used all 4 different criterias that Shigley had in his book. However, the important safety factor that we will be using as our reference
safety factor is Goodman.  
The calculations and formulas details will not be shown until the final polished report.  
An excel table contains the different safety factors at each shaft feature ( shoulders, grooves, keyways, ... )  

Calculations were done with the help of the matlab code that can be found in 08_MATLAB_Scripts in its dedicated folder.
