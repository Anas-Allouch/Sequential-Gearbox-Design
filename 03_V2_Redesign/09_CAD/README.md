Inside solidworks folder, you will find the assemblies, parts and bearings used.  
Two assemblies of the whole gearbox exist:  
- "Sequential_Gearbox": contains the original assembly
- "Sequential_Gearbox_Animation": contains multiple configurations and motion studies. Basically a configuration for each gear engaged alone.
