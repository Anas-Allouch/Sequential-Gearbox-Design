This folder contains sketchs of input and output shaft, in addition to dog clutch components.  
These sketchs are not the final technical drawings, these sketchs are here to show the dimensions used in some calculation and the overall layout of some parts.  
For example, the dimensions on input shaft are used to draw moment diagrams which will be found in 02_Input_Shaft_Analysis folder.
