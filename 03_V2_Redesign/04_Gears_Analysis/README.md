# Gears Analysis
Based on Shigley ways, there are 2 types of failures that can occur in gears: failure by bending, and failure by wear ( or contact ).  
In this folder, you will find a table showing the safety factor for each case, for every gear in the gearbox.  
As always, assumptions and constants are going to be mentioned in the final project report.  

Values are calculated with the MATLAB code that can be found in its corresponding folder.
