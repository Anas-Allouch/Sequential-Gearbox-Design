For the output shaft analysis, we will be using the same moment diagrams used for input shaft.  
The reason why I let myself do that is because the axial positions of gears, where forces are applied, is the same as on the input shaft.  
The difference is that the forces are in the opposite direction shown on the input shaft, excluding reverse gear.  
The real moments diagrams on the output shaft are flipped in comparison to input shaft diagrams, but the absolute value of moments is always the same, so technically we can use the same moment diagrams cause it will not affect calculations.  
Same as input shaft, an excel table includes all safety factors of different shaft fatigue analysis criterias.
