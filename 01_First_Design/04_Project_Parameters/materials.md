# Materials

## Shaft Material

- **Steel:** AISI 4140  
- **Condition:** Quenched and tempered at 425 °C  
- **Ultimate tensile strength, S_ut:** 1250 MPa  
- **Yield strength, S_y:** 1140 MPa  

This material is used for the gearbox shafts in this first complete
acceptable design. These mechanical properties are the reference values
used in the shaft stress and fatigue calculations.

## Gear Material

- **Steel:** 18CrNiMo7-6 (DIN 1.6587)  
- **Heat treatment:** Case hardened  
  - Surface hardness: 56–60 HRC (≈ 600 HB)  
  - Core hardness: 38–42 HRC  
- **Ultimate tensile strength:** 1000–1300 MPa  
- **Yield strength:** 800–1000 MPa  
- **Bending fatigue strength, S_c:** 1650 MPa  
- **Contact fatigue strength, S_t:** 520 MPa  
- **Modulus of elasticity, E:** 205 GPa  
- **Poisson’s ratio, ν:** 0.29  
- **Manufacturing / quality:** Grade 2, quality number 10  

These values are used for AGMA-type bending and contact stress checks in
the gear design and verification.
