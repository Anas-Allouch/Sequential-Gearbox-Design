# General Design Constants

## Gear Geometry

- **Gear type:** Spur gears  
- **Module:** 3.5 mm/tooth
- **Face width, b:** 35 mm  
- **Pressure angle, α:** 20°  

These values are taken as fixed for all gears in this first design 
and are used consistently in gear, shaft, and bearing calculations.

## Components

- **Keys:**  
  - Custom dimensions (non-standard).  
  - Sized specifically for the shaft diameters and torque levels in this
    gearbox rather than using catalog key sizes.

- **Bearings:**  
  - Standard catalog bearings are used.  
  - Selection is based on load capacity and life (L10) according to
    manufacturer data.

- **Retaining rings:**  
  - Standard (catalog) retaining rings.  
  - Grooves and shoulder details follow standard recommendations for
    the chosen ring series.

## Design Scope

These constants define the baseline configuration for the first complete
acceptable gearbox design. Any change to module, face width, pressure
angle, or component standardization would require a global redesign of
gears, shafts, and associated components.
