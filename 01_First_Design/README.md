# First Acceptable Design – Initial Iteration

This folder contains the first **acceptable and technically coherent**
design iteration of the sequential gearbox project. It was created after
multiple early design attempts that revealed significant issues, missing
information, or incorrect assumptions. These early failures were essential
for building a solid understanding of the constraints and requirements of
a real multi-speed gearbox.

Throughout the process, I encountered and learned numerous new concepts
related to gearbox engineering that do not appear in simple single-stage
reducers. Topics such as gear load distribution, shaft fatigue under
combined loading, bearing life calculations, and moment/torque diagrams 
were progressively integrated and refined as I
identified mistakes in previous versions.

This directory therefore serves as:
- a **checkpoint** for the first design that no longer contains major
  conceptual errors or unrealistic assumptions, and  
- a **trace of my progress**, documenting how the project evolved from
  failed early designs into a structured, technically valid gearbox
  model.

## Notes on CAD Models
SolidWorks part models and technical drawings are **not yet finalized**.
They will be developed once all dimensions, stresses, safety factors, and
design decisions are fully validated. The current `03_Shaft_Drawings`
folder contains only preliminary, non-refined versions of the input and
output shafts. Final CAD models and detailed drawings will be added in a
later design stage.
