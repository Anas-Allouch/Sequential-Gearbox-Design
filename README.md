# Sequential Gearbox Design

This project presents the complete design and analysis of a 5-speed sequential gearbox for a rally car.

## Project Scope & Contents

This repository documents the **complete design and analysis process** of a 5-speed sequential gearbox.  
It includes all engineering calculations, modeling, and verification steps based on *Shigley’s Mechanical Engineering Design* and *Le Guide du Dessinateur Industriel (Chevalier)*.

### Main Components & Analyses
- **Gear Design:** module selection, face width, geometry factors, bending and contact stress verification.  
- **Input Shaft Design:** static and fatigue analysis, keyseat and retaining ring groove checks, stress concentration factors.  
- **Output Shaft Design:** torque and moment diagram analysis, critical section evaluation, fatigue and safety factors.  
- **Bearings:** selection, equivalent load calculation, and life estimation.  
- **Keys & Retaining Rings:** dimensioning and verification against shear and crushing.  
- **Housing & Alignment Considerations:** bearing seat fits, shaft shoulders, and axial positioning.  

> The goal is to provide a **complete, transparent, and educational mechanical design example** of a sequential gearbox, from concept to validated dimensions.
