# Sequential Gearbox Design

This project presents the complete design and analysis of a 6-speed sequential gearbox for a high-performance vehicle.

## Project Overview
- Shaft and gear design using Shigleyâ€™s *Mechanical Engineering Design* (metric units).
- Gear verification under AGMA bending & contact stress criteria.
- Shaft fatigue and stress-concentration analysis.
- Bearing selection and life estimation.
- 3D modeling and assembly in SolidWorks.
- Detailed technical drawings in AutoCAD.

## Key Results
target safety factor of 1.5 on shafts
target safety factor of ~1.1-1.3 for gears
